# gasChecker
gasChecker.py  Welcome to this app called gasChecker. This application was designed to tell you how much money you would spend on gas depending on how far you want to drive, what the average miles per gallon your car spends, and the average prices for gas in your area.  This was inspired by the DoorDash app because I wanted to see how much profit I was truly making every time I had to go a certain amount of miles to deliver an order.  In order for the script to work you will need to install geopy, which will convert your address into latitude and longitude points for the gas data API to work.  Special thanks to mygasfeed.com for the API data on gas prices.  #Created by Ennis Machta - June 18, 2018
